# TO-DO-LIST
IT IS A TO-DO-LIST WEB PAGE THAT ALLOWS YOU TO ADD YOUR TASKS AND REMOVE THEM WHEN COMPLETED
THIS IS MADE UPON THE TKINTER MODULE IN PYTHON
I HOPE YOU LIKE THIS PROJECT......
THIS HAS USED SOME OF THE .PNG FILES FOR CERTAIN BUTTONS ETC..
THIS MAKES A TASKLIST.TXT FILE THAT STORES THE TAKS WITHIN IT
IF THS FILE DOESNOT EXIST IN PRIOR THIS WILL CREATE A FILE BY OPENING IN WRITE MODE AND THEN ADD TASKS INTO IT...
